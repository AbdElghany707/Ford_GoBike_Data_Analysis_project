Ford GoBike Data Analysis project by Omar Ahmed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset contains information about individual rides made in San Francisco in February 2019.

#conclusion

• 90.5% of the users are subscribers and 9.5%  are customers.

• percentage of all riders who ride for more than 30 minutes to all users 2.68 %

• Customers' riding duration is longer than subscribers because the customers would normally be the tourists that would visit the city.

• The busiest hours of the day is 5 PM, 88% of all members start riding between 7 AM to 8 PM.

• There are fewer riders on weekend days (2,3,9,10 and so on), the majority of people ride on work days.

• 75% of members are males, females = 23% ,others =2%

• 20-35 (Young Adult) represent 48.4% of our dataset, 36-60 (Adult) 48%, 60+ (Old) 3.6%

• 90 % of members don't share their bike during the trip.

• The percentage of active people who ride for more than two hours decreases the older you get.

• Adults between (36-60) ride slightly faster than other people on average.

• The percentage of people who rides at valocity = 6m/s to all people in our dataset is 0.16%, only 275 member.

• Interestingly! the fastest rider in our data set is a female with a velocity=10 m/s!

Note: The velocity column can never be calculated with high accuracy by the method I have done because the distance is a displacement (Displacement is the straight line distance in a particular direction.)

the actual distance will be much higher than displacement because of (roads, buildings, etc..), but I did this method to get any estimation about the speed of members.
